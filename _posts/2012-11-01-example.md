# Your very first Madcow test

Open your favourite text editor and add the following:
{% highlight bash %}
invokeUrl = http://www.google.com.au/
google_searchBox.value = madcow test automation
google_searchButton.clickLink
waitSeconds = 1
verifyText = <em>Test automation</em> for the rest of us.
{% endhighlight %}
then save the file into the Madcow 2.0 `tests` folder as `GoogleTest.grass`. 

Now create a new file with the following:
{% highlight bash %}
#Google Search
searchBox.name=q
searchButton.name=btnG
{% endhighlight %}
and save the file into the Madcow 2.0 `mappings` folder as `google.grass`. 

Then open up a command prompt or terminal window on Mac and type...
{% highlight bash %}
./runMadcow.sh -t GoogleTest 
{% endhighlight %}
You should see a lot of things start to happen. Don't worry this is just your test running. 

It is running the above `GoogleTest.grass` file, which will basically do the following steps:
- open a web browser to www.google.com.au
- type the value "madcow test automation" into the search box with the html name of "q"
- click the search button/link with the html name of "btnG"
- wait for 1 second while the page reloads
- check that the resulting page has certain text on it

> Note: Each one of those steps listed here directly correlates to the step in the testcase.
