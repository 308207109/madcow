## I have a page that is secured behind a username and password, what now?

You can specify the username and password attributes on each environment in your `madcow-config.xml`. For example:
{% highlight xml %}
<environment name="TEST" username="test" password="p4ssw0rd">
    <invokeUrl>
        <ADDRESSBOOK>https://madcow-test.4impact.net.au:8280/madcow-test-site-2</ADDRESSBOOK>
    </invokeUrl>
</environment>
{% endhighlight %}
This will use the username "test" and the password "p4ssw0rd" when prompted to upon opening the `https://madcow-test.4impact.net.au:8280/madcow-test-site-2`.

Alternatively you can try inlining that information using URL conventions... 
{% highlight xml %}
<environment name="TEST">
    <invokeUrl>
        <ADDRESSBOOK>https://test:p4ssw0rd@madcow-test.4impact.net.au:8280/madcow-test-site-2</ADDRESSBOOK>
    </invokeUrl>
</environment>
{% endhighlight %}

## My page re-direct is not followed on a page when using HTTPS, what now?

If the website being redirected to has a non-supported certificate then you'll need to import the certificate into your local Java JDK using keytool.

Linux:
{% highlight bash %}
keytool -importcert -alias "website-cert" -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts" -file website.cert{code}
{% endhighlight %}

Mac OSX:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo keytool -importcert -alias website -keystore `/usr/libexec/java_home`/lib/security/cacerts -file website.cert
{% endhighlight %}

> The default keychain password is 'changeit'

## How can I comment out a part in my test?
To add single line comment to a test simply prepend a \# to the front of the line.

{% highlight bash %}
# this is a useful test
{% endhighlight %}

Comments are useful for explaining what the test is doing.


## What is a good text editor to use to edit my .Grass Files?

We would recommend something like [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com/) or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) on Windows or [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com) on Mac OSX. Just associate your favourite text editor with the `.grass` file extension.

## How can I tell what version of Madcow I'm using?

By simply running... 
{% highlight bash %}
./runMadcow.sh -v
{% endhighlight %}

you can see the madcow version you used to run against. It is also included in the footer of each of the madcow test results pages. 

## How can I tell what version of Webdriver Grid Server I need?

As of writing this version 2.33 was the recommended version that Madcow 2.0 would prefer to use. 

## How can I run Madcow on my CI Server? 

As well as producing a beautiful madcow-report showing test execution steps. Madcow also produces a industry standard junit xml and html report. 
Simply setup your Continuous Integration (CI) build server to execute something along the lines of: (depending on your build tool's OS)
{% highlight bash %}
./runMadcow.sh -a -e DEV
{% endhighlight %}
which will run all the tests against the configured DEV environment in your madcow-config.xml. 

Then you have to simply point your CI build tool to look for junit style test results in the `/results/junit-report/` folder and you will get beautiful test result build server integration. 
Probably a good idea to get that whole results directory archived with each build too, to ensure you keep copies of the details madcow results as well!
